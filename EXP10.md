### DATE:                                                                            
### REGISTER NUMBER : 212222040168
### AIM: To write a python program for Fibonacci Series and generate test cases using Pytest. 

### Algorithm:

1. Write the python program for Fibonacci Series. 
2. Make sure that function name should be “def test_*():” and the line to be tested 
should have assert keyword at the beginning. 
3. Write some test cases for to be tested and save it as “test_fib.py”. 
4. Open command prompt and change the directory to where pytest and program is 
saved and type “pytest test_fib.py” and run it. 
5. Stop the program.

### Program:

```py
def fibR(n):
  if n==1 or n==2:
    return 1
  return fibR(n-1)+fibR(n-2)
def test_fib_1_equals_1():
  assert fibR(1) == 1
def test_fib_2_equals_1():
  assert fibR(2) == 1
def test_fib_6_equals_8():
  assert fibR(6) == 7

```

### Output:

### Result:
Thus, the python program for Fibonacci Series is tested using pytest and executed and output is verified successfully.
